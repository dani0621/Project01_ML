# ADV CS III: Machine Learning & AI Project 1

# section 1
literature review on machine learning algorithms in general, currrent models, nba prediction

# section 2
my problem

why I chose my model for this problem, variables used

why i chose this dataset (include why I chose it and the dataset, include the common columns used, easily formatted)


## how the actual machine learning process went for me
installed libraries, which ones, why (type the actual libraries)

cleaned up data, explain which columns were dropped, excluded, rows dropped

model selection & training, trained for each separate one, adjusted variables used for prediction for each statistics, show example of one?

using the model, implementing it, show the results

# section 3

discuss results, residuals (means squared)/accuracy of the different linear algorithm (show one fo the algorithm's 

how each of the modles could be improved upon, how i couldn't do win probability ina  more equation because i would need the Offensive efficiency: Points scored per 100 possessions. and defensive efficiency: Points allowed per 100 possessions. and other notes stuff abot how it can be improved in the future

if more time, make a comore coplex probability model, find more stats on opponent, etc.


# Section 4

sources, how I used them
